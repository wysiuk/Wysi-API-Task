### Technologies
When using [Siteglide](https://help.siteglide.com/en/), the three main technologies you will use (Aside from HTML, CSS & JS), will be [Liquid](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/introduction), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) and [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
